# FastHost

âœ¨ **FastHost** is an open-source, self-hosted deployment platform for Python backend apps. Think of it as your own Vercel or Replit, but tailored for FastAPI and Flask using Docker.

With FastHost, you can upload a `.py` file or project archive and instantly deploy it as a running Docker container on your own machine. Itâ€™s perfect for developers, tinkerers, and teams who want full control over their Python backend deploymentsâ€”no third-party cloud required.

We welcome contributions, feedback, and ideas from the community. If youâ€™d like to help shape FastHost, check out the issues, open a pull request, or start a discussion.

#Roadmap:
Phase 1: Core Deployment & Developer Experience (MVP)
Goal: Establish a stable and user-friendly platform for deploying FastAPI/Flask applications via Git, with essential management tools.

1.1 Git-based Deployments (High Priority):

Feature: Implement integration with Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to allow users to connect repositories.

Value: Automates deployments on git push, significantly improving developer workflow and replacing manual zip uploads.

Implementation: Webhooks from Git providers, repository cloning, branch selection for deployment.

1.2 Automated SSL/TLS with Custom Domains (High Priority):

Feature: Allow users to add custom domains and automatically provision/renew SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.

Value: Essential for production-ready applications, building trust, and a professional appearance.

Implementation: DNS validation (e.g., CNAME/TXT record instructions), ACME client integration.

1.3 Environment Variables Management:

Feature: A secure UI for users to define, update, and manage environment variables for their deployed applications.

Value: Separates configuration from code, crucial for different environments (dev, staging, prod) and sensitive data.

Implementation: Encrypted storage of variables, injection into Docker builds/containers.

1.4 Real-time Build & Deployment Logs:

Feature: Stream stdout/stderr from the build process (Docker build, dependencies installation) and deployment steps directly to the user interface.

Value: Provides transparency, enabling users to debug issues during the deployment cycle.

Implementation: WebSockets or SSE for log streaming.

1.5 Basic User Authentication & Project Management:

Feature: Implement a secure user registration and login system. Allow users to create and manage their deployment projects.

Value: Enables multi-user access and organization within the self-hosted instance.

Implementation: Database for users/projects, secure password hashing, session management.

Phase 2: Reliability, Observability & Scalability
Goal: Enhance the platform's stability, provide critical insights into running applications, and lay the groundwork for horizontal scaling.

2.1 Application Logging & Monitoring Dashboard:

Feature: Centralized access to logs generated by the running FastAPI/Flask applications (e.g., from main.py). Implement basic metrics (CPU, memory, request counts).

Value: Indispensable for debugging live applications, identifying performance bottlenecks, and understanding usage patterns.

Implementation: Log aggregation (e.g., filebeat, fluentd, or direct container logs), Prometheus/Grafana or simpler in-house graphing.

2.2 Deployment Rollbacks:

Feature: Allow users to revert a deployed application to any previous successful deployment version.

Value: A critical safety net for recovering quickly from bad deployments or unintended side effects.

Implementation: Maintain historical Docker image references/tags for each deployment.

2.3 Horizontal Scaling (Basic):

Feature: Enable users to define and run multiple instances of a single application.

Value: Improves application availability and performance under increased load.

Implementation: Integrate with NGINX (or similar) as a load balancer to distribute traffic to multiple Docker containers/instances. UI to adjust instance count.

2.4 Improved Error Handling & Notifications:

Feature: Clear, actionable error messages in the UI for failed builds/deployments. Implement email or webhook notifications for critical events.

Value: Reduces user frustration and keeps them informed about the status of their deployments.

Phase 3: Advanced Features & Ecosystem Expansion
Goal: Differentiate the platform with powerful capabilities, offering greater flexibility and catering to more complex use cases.

3.1 Persistent Storage Integration:

Feature: Provide options for attaching persistent storage volumes to applications for data that needs to survive deployments (e.g., user uploads, database files).

Value: Enables stateful applications, broadening the types of projects the platform can host.

Implementation: Docker volumes, bind mounts, or integration with network storage solutions if applicable to the underlying infrastructure.

3.2 Custom Buildpacks/Build Steps:

Feature: Allow users to define more custom build processes beyond just a Dockerfile, perhaps through a platform.yml or similar configuration.

Value: Offers greater flexibility for non-standard build requirements or specialized runtimes.

Implementation: Extend the build orchestration to support custom scripts or logic.

3.3 Serverless Function (Python) Support:

Feature: Enable users to deploy individual Python functions as serverless endpoints without managing a full application server.

Value: Caters to microservices architectures, background tasks, and event-driven workloads, similar to AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

Implementation: Custom runtime environment for functions, API Gateway integration.

3.4 CLI Tool:

Feature: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the platform (deploying, checking status, viewing logs).

Value: Appeals to developers who prefer terminal-based workflows, enabling scripting and automation.

Implementation: Python CLI with API calls to your platform's backend.

3.5 Webhooks for Deployment Events:

Feature: Allow users to configure webhooks that trigger on deployment success, failure, or other lifecycle events.

Value: Enables integration with external services (e.g., Slack notifications, CI/CD pipelines).

3.6 Comprehensive Documentation & Community:

Feature: Create extensive documentation covering setup, usage, troubleshooting, and API. Foster a community around the open-source project.

Value: Crucial for adoption and self-sufficiency, reducing support burden.
