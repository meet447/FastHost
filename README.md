🚀 FastHost

FastHost is an open-source, self-hosted deployment platform for Python backend applications.
Think of it as your own Vercel or Replit, but optimized for FastAPI and Flask—all powered by Docker, running on your own infrastructure.

Upload a .py file or project archive, and FastHost instantly spins up your app as a live Docker container.
Perfect for developers, tinkerers, and teams who want full control over their backend deployments—no cloud provider required.

🛣 Roadmap

Phase 1: 🧱 Core Deployment & Developer Experience (MVP)

Goal: Build a reliable and easy-to-use platform for deploying FastAPI/Flask apps via Git, with essential management tools.

✅ 1.1 Git-Based Deployments
	•	What: Integrate with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
	•	Why: Deploy automatically on every git push
	•	How: Use webhooks, repo cloning, branch selection

✅ 1.2 Custom Domains + Auto SSL
	•	What: Add custom domains with auto-provisioned SSL (Let’s Encrypt)
	•	Why: Production-ready, trusted deployments
	•	How: ACME client, DNS verification (CNAME/TXT)

✅ 1.3 Environment Variable Management
	•	What: Secure UI for managing .env variables
	•	Why: Separate code from configuration for all environments
	•	How: Encrypted storage, injected at build/runtime

✅ 1.4 Real-Time Logs
	•	What: Stream stdout/stderr during build and deployment
	•	Why: Debug issues in real-time
	•	How: Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE)

✅ 1.5 User Auth & Project Dashboard
	•	What: Basic user accounts and project management
	•	Why: Support for multi-user workflows
	•	How: Secure auth, project DB, sessions

Phase 2: 🔎 Reliability, Observability & Scalability

Goal: Improve robustness, visibility, and prepare for scale.

🔧 2.1 App Logs & Monitoring Dashboard
	•	Centralized logs and basic metrics (CPU, memory, requests)
	•	Integration ideas: Filebeat, Prometheus, Grafana

🔁 2.2 Deployment Rollbacks
	•	Revert to any previous successful deployment
	•	Store Docker image versions with metadata

📈 2.3 Horizontal Scaling
	•	Run multiple instances of an app
	•	Load balancing via NGINX (or similar), UI to scale instances

🔔 2.4 Error Handling & Notifications
	•	Clear error messages for builds/deployments
	•	Email/webhook alerts for failures or critical events

Phase 3: 🧠 Advanced Features & Ecosystem Expansion

Goal: Add power features, greater flexibility, and community growth.

💾 3.1 Persistent Storage
	•	Attach volumes for stateful apps (uploads, DBs, etc.)
	•	Via Docker volumes, bind mounts, or network storage

🔨 3.2 Custom Buildpacks / Build Steps
	•	Define custom builds beyond Dockerfile
	•	Use a platform.yml or similar

🧬 3.3 Python Serverless Functions
	•	Deploy Python functions as lightweight endpoints
	•	Similar to AWS Lambda, ideal for microservices and event-based apps

🖥 3.4 CLI Tool
	•	Deploy, check logs/status from the terminal
	•	Python-based CLI with API integration

🌐 3.5 Webhooks for Deployments
	•	Trigger external services on deploy success/failure
	•	Integrate with Slack, Discord, CI tools

📚 3.6 Documentation & Community
	•	Full guides: setup, usage, APIs, FAQs
	•	Build an engaged open-source community
