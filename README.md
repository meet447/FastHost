✨ FastHost

FastHost is an open-source, self-hosted deployment platform for Python backend apps — like Vercel or Replit, but built for FastAPI and Flask using Docker.

With FastHost, you can upload a .py file or project archive and instantly deploy it as a running Docker container on your own machine. It’s perfect for developers, tinkerers, and teams who want full control over their Python backend deployments without relying on third-party cloud services.
